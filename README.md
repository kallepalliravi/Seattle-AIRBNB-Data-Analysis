## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Seattle AIRBNB data from Kaggle to understand the following questions:

1. What are the top 10 neighborhoods in Seattle with most number of hosts and super hosts??
2. What are top 10 neighborhoods with highest and lowest avg. listing price?
3. What is the % breakdown of property types in Seattle in the listings database?
4. What % of listings are for entire place compared to private or share rooms in listings database?
5. Are the number of hosts increasing every year in Seattle?
6. What is the average price of listings per month?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is 1 notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions.  The notebook is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  

Also include the data files whcih were downloaded from Kaggle. To answer the above business questions listings and calendar data files were used.

## Results<a name="results"></a>
